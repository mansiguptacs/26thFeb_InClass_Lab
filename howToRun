Way 1 — TLS 1.3 + mTLS: secure_sender_tls.py ↔ secure_receiver_tls.py
Way 2 — Raw TCP + app‑level E2EE: secure_sender_e2ee.py ↔ secure_receiver_e2ee.py


How to test large file transfer with TLS (Way 1)

Start receiver (server side) in one terminal:
cd python secure_receiver_tls.py received_tls.bin 0.0.0.0 9443

Start sender (client side) in another terminal:
cd python secure_sender_tls.py bigfile.bin 127.0.0.1 9443
Replace bigfile.bin with your large file path.

Progress and final SHA-256 integrity check will be printed on both sides.



How to test large file transfer with E2EE over raw TCP (Way 2):

Start receiver:
cd python secure_receiver_e2ee.py received_e2ee.bin 0.0.0.0 9444
Start sender:
cd python secure_sender_e2ee.py bigfile.bin 127.0.0.1 9444



This path requires the cryptography package; if needed:
pip install cryptography
Verifying both ways worked for large data
After each transfer, compare the original and received files:
shasum -a 256 bigfile.bin received_tls.binshasum -a 256 bigfile.bin received_e2ee.bin
The hashes should match in each pair.
